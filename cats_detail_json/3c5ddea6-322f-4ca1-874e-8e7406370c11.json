He loved and was loved by so many.\n\nBy day, lunchtime queues of working adults formed, each hoping to steal moments with him \u2026 sneaking in a cuddle, or treats. By night, he claimed the laps of stray cat feeders, simply hanging out and watching over them.\n\nBut not anymore \u2026\n\nMackie was suddenly and wrongfully relocated 5-6km away from his only home and carers. Left to die, all alone\u2026  a slow painful death from severe injuries, within a week. He was picked up and put down by SPCA. On the same day. His last heartbreaking photo is like a textbook animal abuse case.\n\nHis feeders and carers frantically searched for him through weeks and weeks of calls, emails, and hours and hours of searching parks... no one claimed to have relocated him, no shelter claimed to have him. Yet one month later \u2026 they found out Mackie had already died.\n\nGo well Mackie. Rest in peace. \nYour feeders and carers will never forget you, and your cruel and questionable end.
